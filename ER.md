# ER: Requirements Specification Component

## A1: WeBid

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed by a small group of developers from LBAW 22/23, WeBid is a product that markets to the individual user who wishes to bid on items online.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of this project is to develop a web application capable of supporting an online auction service. It allows its users not only to bid on existing items but also to be able to place their own items up for auction.
The use of technology is increasing day by day, therefore people are relying more and more on it to accomplish specific tasks in their lives. It would be ideal to have an application that would ease users' lives when trying to either purchase a product or sell one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform will have an adaptive & intuitive design, independent of the system or capabilities of the user, having products organized throughout different categories, improving the users experience when searching for a more specific product at auction. Also, it will automatically manage the bidding deadline and determine the winning bid. Each product will have assigned its current bid and time left until the auction expires.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the purpose of maintaining a trustworthy service, bidders will be able to rate the sellers of the auction they took part in, ensuring reliability for future users. They will also have the possibility to view the bidding history for each auction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be an instant notification system, keeping track of the auctions so that users don’t miss anything out, such as when there is a new bid or if the action is about to end or actually ended already.<br>
Users are separated into groups with different permissions: the system managers, the authenticated users and the non authenticated users. Anything a group can do, the previous also can.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system managers will be the ones moderating the application, ensuring there are no conflicts. They will have the permissions to manage the auctions, block user accounts and delete inappropriate content.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authenticated users can either be bidders or auction owners, having the privileges to bid on auctions as well as create & manage the status of their own ones. By allowing them to manage their auctions, they’re able to set a bid floor, a minimum bid increase, a bid time, and even cancel the auction, which may issue them a penalty. They’re allowed the freedom to edit their personal information in their profile, such as username, email, password, profile picture and, if they wish to, delete the account, with only the bidding registry, list of bought items and past reviews being left in the system.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-authenticated users, on the other hand, won’t have those permissions, only being able to search and browse the different products and auctions either by text input or filters and see bidding users profiles. User registration and login are also available.

#### 3.2. Technical requirements

| Identifier | Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| TR01 | Availability | The system must be up and running 24/7 |
| TR02 | Accessibility | The system must guarantee that everyone is capable of navigating throughout the whole website, despite their capabilities. |
| TR03 | Usability | The system should be simple and intuitive, so that everyone can take advantage of all the features of the website with easy |
| **TR04** | **Performance** | **The system’s response time should be less than 2s to ensure a good user experience.<br><br>With a delay greater than 2 seconds, user experience starts to degrade, specially in a website like WeBid, were some operations are time critical, like placing bids and closing auctions. For that reason, we ought to ensure minimal response times between the users and the server.** |
| **TR05** | **Web application** | **The system is to be implemented as a web application with dynamic pages, using standard HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. <br><br> Access to the website should be possible from a standard web browser, since we have multiple users, who, more than certainly, don't use the same device or browser.** |

| **TR08** | **Security** | **The system must protect all the sensitive user information from unauthorized access through the use of an authentication system and attack prevention and protection methods. <br><br> User privacy and security are two big concerns in this day and age. Data breaches are always bound to happen, since no system is bullet proof, but our objective is to mitigate them as much as possible.** |

## A3: Information Architecture

The goal of this artifact is to give a brief insight on the way information is presented on the system. This will be achieved through the use of a Sitemap and a couple Wireframes of the main pages.


### 1. Sitemap

Diagram representation of the flow and hierarchy between pages. It's divided into five different areas, which are:
- **Info Pages**: Pages with general information relevant to the users.
- **Admin Pages**: Pages for website management.
- **Authentication Pages**: Pages for account authentication and recovery.
- **User Pages**: Pages that display users information.
- **Auction Pages**: Pages dedicated to searching for auctions, displaying their information and bidding.

### 2. Wireframes

The following wireframes are an attempt at demonstrating what two of the main pages will look like: the home page and a generic auction page.

#### UI01: Homepage
